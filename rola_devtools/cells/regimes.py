"""THE REGIME AXES: where in the routing distribution a carry cell's draw sits, declared and proven (moved from rola's
benchmarks/cells/regimes.py).

Routing is a moving distribution -- the gain knob alone sweeps the candidate fraction from about 0.96 to 0.09 in
training -- so a cell set drawn at one density is an artifact. Every carry cell therefore states a value on each axis
below (`carry.json`'s `regime`), and `realize` PROVES the draw sits there before any reader sees it: a cell that cannot
demonstrate its declared regime refuses to realize, so no oracle and no measurement can run a cell that is somewhere
other than where it says. Independent per-token sampling manufactures anti-structure (sides that never
coincide, supports that never persist), which is why the coherent, tied, anti and cold corners are cells of their own
rather than something a random draw is hoped to reach.

Every check reads the per-level amplitudes and never a leaf product, so proving a 65536-token, 65536-leaf cell costs a
pass over its `L x sum_l B_l` digits. Symbols: ``L`` tokens, ``B_l`` level ``l``'s digit count, ``W`` the token window
the cells are stated against (`rola_devtools.cells.carry.WINDOW`).
