"""THE CLOCK LOCK SEAM (moved from rola's `tools/clock_lock.py`): the host says how its clock is locked; the harness
only asks.

A GPU's boost governor moves the SM clock with power, and a kernel number is comparable
across runs only at one clock (rola's `docs/internals/common/sm_clock.md`). How a clock is locked
is a fact about the HOST -- `nvidia-smi -lgc` as root on Linux, an elevated scheduled task
on a Windows host under WSL, nothing at all on a box that forbids it -- so it lives in the dev
config's `clock.json` (`rola_devtools.config`; rola's `python tools/dev.py clock --mhz N` writes it):

    {"ghz": 1.665,
     "lock":   ["/mnt/c/Windows/System32/schtasks.exe", "/run", "/tn", "gpu-lock"],
     "unlock": ["/mnt/c/Windows/System32/schtasks.exe", "/run", "/tn", "gpu-unlock"]}

The harness locks at start, proves the lock with the in-kernel clock read, unlocks on every
exit path, and refuses a row whose measured clock is off the lock. Without a clock a run is
UNLOCKED: rows carry their measured clock and are marked so in the ledger, as dirty rows are.
