"""THE HOST-COMPUTE BUDGET, ONE POOL FOR EVERY CPU-HEAVY TOOL (moved from rola's `tools/host_budget.py`; LOCKS brief,
Blake 2026-08-29: "add locks around our tooling where it makes sense ... maybe semaphores, allow some controlled level
of parallelism").

**WHY ONE POOL.** rola's `build_lock.py` once counted `cicc` processes only -- but a `compute-sanitizer` run, a
`clang-tidy --cuda-host-only` pass over one translation unit, and a pytest tier that forks workers are all host-CPU-heavy
in the same way a compile is, and none of them drew from the budget a compile did. Three of those beside a full-budget
compile is the "12+ cicc on one host" shape with a different process name on each contender. Slot counts live in exactly
one place -- here -- and rola's `build_lock.py` draws its compile slots from this pool.

**THE MECHANISM**, the one `rola_devtools.locks.gpu` also uses, generalized to N callers: `budget_slots()` lock files
under `host.lock_dir` (dev config; default `/tmp` -- a test points every acquirer at a throwaway directory instead of the
real, possibly contended, locks). `acquire(n)` waits for at least one free slot (never proceeds with zero), then
opportunistically takes up to `n` more that are free right now without waiting further for them -- so N concurrent
callers each make some progress rather than one winning the whole budget or all of them deadlocking.
`acquire(n, exclusive=True)` waits for and holds every slot (a gate draw).

**REENTRANT BY CONSTRUCTION**: an acquire sets `ROLA_HOST_BUDGET_HELD` in the process environment; a nested acquire that
finds the marker set is a no-op, so an outer tool that holds slots and calls an inner tool that also acquires cannot
self-deadlock. `host.locks_trace` prints every acquire and release with the holder pid and slot count, for every lock in
this module and `rola_devtools.locks.gpu` alike.

**FILE LOCKS.** A handful of tools write ONE shared artifact from potentially-concurrent invocations (a ratify manifest,
a generated header) -- not a counting resource, just mutual exclusion over one output. `file_lock(name)` is that
primitive: one named exclusive lock, short-held, reentrant the same way.
